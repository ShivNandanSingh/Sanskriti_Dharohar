                                The main prasad offered at Jal Mandir, Pawapuri, is <strong>simple vegetarian
                                    food</strong>, reflecting Jain traditions. Devotees often receive <strong>dry
                                    fruits, sweets, and fruits</strong> as prasad after worship. During major Jain
                                festivals like Mahavir Jayanti and Diwali, special prasad may include <strong>sweetmeats
                                    (mithai)</strong> and <strong>dry snacks</strong>, always prepared without onion,
                                garlic, or any root vegetables, in accordance with Jain dietary rules.
                            </p>

                                <em>Note:</em> The temple is famous for its spiritual atmosphere and the sacred
                                <strong>Charan Paduka</strong> (footprints) of Lord Mahavira, rather than elaborate food
                                offerings. The prasad is simple, symbolizing purity and non-violence.

                            <p>
                                Jal Mandir in Pawapuri, Bihar, is a sacred Jain pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord
                                Mahavira,
                                where he attained Nirvana. It is renowned for its spiritual significance and tranquil
                                setting within a lotus-filled pond. The temple is primarily a place of worship and
                                pilgrimage, and traditional Jain rituals are performed here. While Pawapuri is mentioned
                                as
                                an ideal location for intimate and spiritual ceremonies, there is no public evidence or
                                official guidance suggesting that marriage ceremonies are regularly conducted inside the
                                Jal
                                Mandir itself. Visitors are expected to respect the sanctity of the temple, follow a
                                modest
                                dress code, and adhere to Jain traditions during their visit. For those considering a
                                wedding in Pawapuri, arrangements may be possible in the surrounding areas, but not
                                within
                                the temple premises itself due to its religious importance.

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nestled in the serene town of Pawapuri, Bihar, the <strong>Jal Mandir</strong> (Water
                            Temple) is a breathtaking Jain shrine that appears to float gracefully on a vast
                            lotus-filled lake. Revered for its spiritual significance and architectural splendor, this
                            temple marks the sacred spot where Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, attained
                            Nirvana and was cremated around 527 BCE.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Jal Mandir was constructed by King Nandivardhan, the elder brother of Lord Mahavira, to
                            commemorate the site of the Tirthankara’s cremation. According to legend, after Mahavira’s
                            last rites, devotees collected so much sacred soil from the site that a large pit formed,
                            which filled with rainwater and became the beautiful pond we see today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The temple is one of the five principal Jain temples in Pawapuri and enshrines the
                            <em>Charan Paduka</em>—the sacred footprints of Lord Mahavira—serving as a powerful reminder
                            of his teachings and eternal presence.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Structure:</strong> Built entirely of gleaming white marble, the temple is
                                designed in the shape of a <em>Vimana</em> (chariot), symbolizing the soul’s journey
                                toward liberation. The temple stands on a raised platform in the center of a rectangular
                                pond, surrounded by blooming lotuses and vibrant aquatic life.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bridge:</strong> A beautifully sculpted 600-foot (about 180 meters) stone bridge
                                connects the temple to the shore, making each step toward the shrine feel like a
                                spiritual journey across water.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Carvings and Decor:</strong> The temple’s walls and pillars are adorned with
                                intricate carvings depicting scenes from Jain mythology and the life of Lord Mahavira.
                                The symmetry and geometric patterns throughout the temple reflect the Jain philosophy of
                                balance and harmony in the universe.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Pond:</strong> The surrounding pond, spanning approximately 16.8 acres, is home
                                to lotus flowers, colorful fish, and migratory birds, creating a tranquil and
                                picturesque atmosphere.
                            </li>
