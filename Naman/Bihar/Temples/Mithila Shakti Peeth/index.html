                                    During the era of the Darbhanga Maharajas, education was modernized. Maharaja

                                    and made it a free institution, while also establishing several free middle schools
                                    across the estate.

                                    Efforts were made to promote Sanskrit, vernacular, English, and female education in

                            temple is dedicated to <strong>Goddess Durga</strong>, worshipped here as <strong>Uma or
                                Mahadevi</strong>, and holds immense significance in Hindu mythology as the site where

                            <li>
                                According to legend, after Goddess Sati's self-immolation, Lord Shiva wandered the
                                universe in grief, carrying her body. Lord Vishnu, to restore cosmic order, used his
                                Sudarshan Chakra to dismember Sati's body, and her left shoulder fell at Mithila, making
                                it a powerful center of divine feminine energy.
                            </li>
