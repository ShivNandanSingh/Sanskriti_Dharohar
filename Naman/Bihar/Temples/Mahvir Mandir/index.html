                        <strong>Mahavir Mandir</strong> is one of the most revered Hindu temples dedicated to Lord
                        Hanuman, situated in the heart of Patna, Bihar, near the Patna Junction railway station. Every
                        year, millions of devotees from across India and abroad visit this temple to seek blessings and
                        experience its divine aura.<br>
                        The temple is not only a spiritual center but also a symbol of faith and resilience for the
                        people of Bihar.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Historical Legacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The origins of Mahavir Mandir date back to the early 18th century, believed to have been
                        established by Swami Balanand, a saint of the Ramanandi sect, around 1730 CE. The temple gained
                        immense prominence in 1947, when a large influx of Hindu refugees arrived in Patna following the
                        partition of India.<br>
                        The present grand marble structure was constructed between 1983 and 1985, under the stewardship
                        of Acharya Kishore Kunal and the Mahavir Mandir Trust, making it one of the largest and most
                        prosperous temples in North India.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Architectural Splendor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Spanning over 10,000 square feet, Mahavir Mandir is a three-level marvel, blending traditional
                        Hindu and contemporary architectural styles. The temple's façade is adorned with intricate
                        carvings and mythological motifs, while its towering spire and vibrant flags create an
                        awe-inspiring sight.<br>
                        The sanctum houses two unique idols of Lord Hanuman, representing protection for the virtuous
                        and destruction of evil. The temple also features shrines dedicated to Lord Rama, Krishna,
                        Shiva, Durga, and other deities, offering a holistic spiritual experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Religious and Cultural Significance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mahavir Mandir is renowned for its miraculous legends, including the self-manifested idol of
                        Sankat Mochan Hanuman and the ever-abundant Naivedyam prasad. The temple is especially vibrant
                        during festivals like <strong>Hanuman Jayanti</strong> and <strong>Rama Navami</strong>, when
                        thousands of devotees gather for grand celebrations and rituals.<br>
                        The temple is open to people of all faiths, reflecting its inclusive spirit and importance in
                        Patna’s cultural identity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Facilities and Community Service</h2>
                    <p>
                        Managed by the <strong>Shri Mahavir Sthan Nyas Samiti</strong>, the temple provides a range of
                        facilities for pilgrims, including clean prasad counters, donation services, and resting areas.
                        The trust is also known for its charitable initiatives, supporting education, healthcare, and
                        disaster relief across Bihar.

                                    by Tirupati's laddu. Made from pure besan (gram flour), ghee, sugar, cashew nuts,
                                    raisins, and cardamom, these laddus are prepared by skilled South Indian artisans
                                    using traditional methods. The aroma and taste of this prasad are unmatched and have
                                    become a symbol of devotion for devotees visiting the temple. Naivedyam Laddu is
                                    available in various pack sizes and is renowned for its purity and rich
