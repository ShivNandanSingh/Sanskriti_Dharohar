                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nestled in the historic city of Patna, Bihar, the <strong>Kamaldah Jain Temple</strong>
                            stands as a beacon of spiritual tranquility and ancient heritage. Revered as one of the
                            oldest Jain temples in India, this sacred site is cherished by devotees and history
                            enthusiasts alike for its serene ambiance, spiritual significance, and centuries-old
                            legacy.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                        <p>
                            The temple complex dates back to <strong>1729 CE</strong> and is believed to be built on the
                            site where the illustrious Jain acharya <strong>Sthulabhadra</strong> (297–198 BCE) spent
                            his final days. Sthulabhadra, a prominent preceptor of the Śvētāmbara sect, was the
                            successor of Bhadrabahu and played a pivotal role in shaping Jain philosophy. The temple
                            also commemorates <strong>Mahamuni Sudarshan Swami</strong>, whose ancient footprints are
                            enshrined here, making it a revered Siddha Kshetra (place of liberation)].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The temple’s historical inscription not only marks its construction but also confirms the
                            ancient identity of Patliputra (modern Patna), linking it to the Mauryan era and the
                            spiritual journeys of Jain sages.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Temple Layout:</strong> The complex is set atop a sturdy brick mound and
                                comprises two to three compact temples. The main shrine is dedicated to
                                <strong>Tirthankara Neminath Ji</strong>, while another temple honors
                                <strong>Sthulabhadra</strong> and a third is devoted to <strong>Sudarshana
                                    Swami</strong>.
                            </li>

                                and carvings, especially those depicting the life and teachings of Sthulabhadra. The
                                shrine dedicated to Sudarshana Swami houses his sacred black stone footprints, lovingly
                                covered in saffron as a daily offering, and the temple door features an image of
                                Bhairava, symbolizing protection.

                        <p>
                            Kamaldah Jain Temple is a vital pilgrimage site, especially for followers of the Śvētāmbara
                            and Digambara Jain traditions. It is part of the Jain circuit of Bihar and draws devotees
                            during major festivals like <strong>Mahavir Jayanti</strong> and the annual Nirvana Diwas of
                            Sudarshan Swami. The temple’s legacy is intertwined with the spiritual journeys of Jain
                            acharyas, including Acharya Umaswami and the legendary emperor Chandragupta Maurya, who is
                            believed to have spent time in Patliputra.
